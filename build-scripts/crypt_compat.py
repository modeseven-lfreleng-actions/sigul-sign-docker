"""
Compatibility shim for the crypt module (removed in Python 3.13).

This module provides a drop-in replacement for the standard library crypt module
that was deprecated in Python 3.11 and removed in Python 3.13.

It uses passlib to provide SHA-512 password hashing compatible with the
original crypt.crypt() function.

        Args:

            salt: The salt string.  Real callers will pass an
                  ``$6$...`` SHA-512 crypt salt; legacy code may

                  ``crypt(password, 'xx')`` as a timing-attack

            The hashed password string in crypt format, or - for
            placeholder/invalid salts - a deterministic non-crypt
            string that will never equal a real crypt result and
